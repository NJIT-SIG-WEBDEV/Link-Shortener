##SIG Backend - Laravel Link Shortener
Hi everyone, Jay asked me to post up what I had so far for anyone who is working on the link shortener web app using the PHP framework Laravel 5. For those unfamiliar with Laravel 5 I know there a lot of folders but the ones I will be working in the most will be:

- app
- app/http
- resources
 
I will be working on this project all week until the next meeting but I hope the get it completely done by this coming Sunday Feb 28. I'll continue adding to this Readme and do my best in documenting my code. 

Thanks,<br>
Dennis
